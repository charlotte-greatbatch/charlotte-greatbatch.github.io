      <p class="headings"> JavaScript's relationship to HTML & CSS </p>
      <p>Imagine you're at the supermarket and you find a beautiful vanilla sponge cake. You think it's time to treat yourself, you buy the cake and take it home. When you get home you realise
        you want the cake with some pizzazz, you look in your pantry and find some sprinkles, you have some icing sugar and some awesome food colourings lying around. Let's give this cake some 
      pizzazz! You make some beautiful coloured icing sugar frosting, multiple colours and you slap it all over the cake. BAM you've got a rainbow cake! Now, you drizzle some sprinkles all over the cake,
    how amazing is this! You've got a sparkly rainbow cake! Time to cut a slice and dig in.</p>
    <p> To put it in simple terms, the cake is HTML. Functional if left on its own, however much better when you add CSS. I mean, frosting and sparkles! That's the beauty with CSS is the multitude
      of colours, different fonts and just overall pizzazz you can give a "cake". Then, how does JavaScript fit into the whole mix? Well, YOU are JavaScript! You're the brains behind the beautiful idea,
      and you have the power to manipulate and re-arrange things as you see fit. A cake is still a cake, and sprinkles are just sprinkles until your beautiful brain can put them all together and make something
      magical!

    <p class="headings">Control flow and loops</p>
    <p> Control flow is the order which the computer executes code, top to bottom.</p>
    <p>A loop is a sequence of instructions that is repeated until a certain condiiton has been met.</p>
    <p>In other words, you want to go for a walk, but you can't go for a walk without socks and shoes on. To continue your control flow, you must complete the loop of putting 1 sock on each foot,
      then 1 shoe on each foot and you're ready to continue your day!

<p class="headings"> What is the DOM? </p>
<p>The DOM or Document Object Model treats the webpage on your browser as a tree so you can see all of the branches (paragraphs (also divs), headings, titles, footers, colours etc) within one interface. </p>
<p><span> <img class="DOM" src="../images/blogpage2.png" alt="A screenshot of the DOM on this page"></span></p>
<p>If you wanted to, you can change things like headings or text straight from the DOM itself! Without having to load up files and put them in a code editor, it can be done on the browser itself.</p>
<p>You can use the DOM on any web page, however it will only stay changed on your local page until you refresh the page. Then it will change back to its original heading/text. 
</p> <span><img class="DOM" src="../images/deva2.png" alt="Dev Academy website saying Invest in your shoes and learn skydiving"> </span>
<p>Here is an example of me changing the <a href=https://devacademy.co.nz/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIlISXzsu69wIVhJhmAh0knwQ-EAAYASAAEgIcXPD_BwE>Dev Academy</a> website on my local browser. </p>
</div>

<div class="blank">
<p class="headings"> Accessing data from arrays and objects </p>
<p>Arrays have information that display items via <span class=index>index</span> under one name/variable. e.g </p>
<p> favCandy=<span class="index">["chocolate", "sour", "lollipops"]</span></p>
<p>Objects have information based on one <span class="key">key</span> and one <span class="value">value</span>. e.g</p>
<p> myCat= {</p>
  <p><span class="key">name</span>=<span class=value>"Zelda"</span></p>
  <p><span class="key">breed</span>=<span class=value>"Tabby"</span></p>
  <p><span class="key">year</span>=<span class=value>"2016"</span></p>
  <p>}</p>

<p>So I could ask the computer for the second (technically it's considered 1st position because array's start at 0 but lets not get into it right now) favourite candy and it would tell me sour, but I cannot ask the computer for the second <span class="value">value</span> of myCat as it is programmed by the <span class="key">key</span> and not the <span class="index">index</span>.</p>

<div class="welcome">
<p class="headings">What's a function? Why is it helpful?</p>
<p> A function is a list of instructions you give the computer to do something, through JavaScript.</p>
<p>Functions are helpful because it gives web developers a small amount of code that can be re-used, whether it's complicated with extra loops and conditionals (lets not talk about it) or you want it to say hello!
  It also helps to keep code organised if you need to de-bug or fix some code you made hours earlier, instead of getting your reading glasses out and trawling through everything you can have a better idea where everything is.
