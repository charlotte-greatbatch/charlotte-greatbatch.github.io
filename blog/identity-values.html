<div class="welcome">
<p class="subheading">Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, and the consequences of your action.</p>

<p class="nicer-text"> Whether I would move to the USA to be with my partner of if he would move to NZ to be with me. We both took time and discussed at length our happiness, long-term growth and stability at the time. We decided that he would move to NZ to be with me.
The consquences that have occured is that he doesn't get to see his family other than facetime, and he is the last to know about any family event e.g close family member passing away. </p>
</div>

<div>
<p class="subheading">Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.</p>

<p class="nicer-text">My culture has taught me that family is the most important, however in my personal experience it's not always blood-related family that mean the most to you. 
Happiness is also very important, you have to do what makes you happy and not what other people think is "right". 
Sometimes stepping away from those situations can help you understand them from a different perspective and make you realise how it influences you as a person. </p>
</div>

<div class="welcome">
<p class="subheading">Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development.</p>

<p class="nicer-text"> My strength is that I love listening and I love learning new concepts which can benefit me in developing my skills for any new endevour/experience that I partake in.
My litmitation is that I struggle to find confidence within myself when I am in a new job or learning facility. I choose to be self-aware of this and try to find ways to feel more comfortable in my environment. </p>
</div>

<div>
<p class="subheading">Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they intersect with learning obstacles.</p>

<p class="nicer-text">I think my love for learning will help immesensely with DA as it gives me a drive to understand why certain things aren't working for me and how to fix them rather than giving up after 20mins with no solutions. 
Also having the curiosity and finding the right tools to help with fixing a problem.</p>
</div>

<div class="welcome">

<p class="subheading">Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension.
Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.</p>

<p class="nicer-text">One of the stores I worked at, we would also fulfill online orders. One woman I worked with just didn't see eye to eye from the get go however it became more apparent when we started to do these orders together.
We would both make occassional faults, and she would never own up to the faults she was making and blame it on myself or another co-worker. So it was hard for the manager to pin-point what was going wrong and why, so there would never be any progress towards making sure the mistake wouldn't happen again.
When these things were happening I would try to talk to her myself to see what was going on and why the mistakes had been made, however she would get defensive immediately and wouldn't have a clear answer as to what was happening. 
I became frustrated only because I was trying to help her in fixing those mistakes and move forward. At the time I would relay the information to the manager, she would call in the staff member, they would talk and it would be "resolved". 
I think looking back, instead of having us doing different orders it might've been better if we worked together on orders so we could both see where each other was at and keep an eye on how things were being handled. 
If there were issues that would still pop up it would be more effective to schedule 15mins in a day where myself, staff member and manager would meet so the three of us could talk together about solutions to the problems and hear each other out at face value.</p>
