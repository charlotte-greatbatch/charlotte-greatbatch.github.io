            My long-term goal or dream is to become a web developer capable of traveling the world, so I can work anywhere I go. My partner is from the USA and I would love to live over there with his family for a few years and still be able to work for an NZ company,
          or work for a company based in the US and still be able to travel around and experience all of the tourist things.

            One of my favourite things about life is I love listening, I love watching ted talks and I love learning new things every single day.
            When it comes to web development, even in the past couple of weeks learning the basics, I've felt myself become more curious. Especially when something didn't work the previous day,
            I feel even more motivated and determined to figure out what went wrong and how I can fix it and how I can make it work the next.
         </p>

  <p class="blog-entries nicer-text">
      It's incredibly important to maintain self-care no matter how far into a project or assignment you are. Even 5minute breaks every 30mins or hour will make a big difference to your mental load.
      Personally, I'm treating DA like a job. Get up and get to "work" at 9am, finish sometime after 5pm, making sure to take a break every half hour to hour. Drinking plenty of water, trying to get a healthy amount of sleep.
      When in the position to work with others, I will be respectful of what they need whether its help, listening or engagement.
      Its enevitable that things will become stressful when things move further through foundations and bootcamp, I think it's important for when it feels like the stress is getting out of control to
      being honest with yourself and the people around you. I believe it would be best to formulate an idea of why it feels stressful, what's not working,
      take a breath and step away for 10-15mins. If it still feels stressful/things are not working out and I've already asked for help through the discord, it's best to try and schedule a one on one with my
      facillitator to walk through a plan of how to get over this roadblock. I think it's also important to share my feelings with some loved ones around me to have some moral support as well.
  </p>

  <p class="nicer-text">
    The main things I would expect from the facillitator's themselves is support and understanding, which they already do anyway. 
    Personally, sometimes things don't click for me as easily as it does for other people so just having some understanding when I ask multiple questions just so the certain idea solidifies for me.
  </p>
    
  <p class="blog-entries nicer-text">
      I do not have any other commitments that might interfere with my time at DA.

        My goal/career pathway after Dev Academy would be to land a Junior Developer role so I can properly start my career as a web developer. I want to be in an environment where I can continue learning and growing so I can look back in
        5 years time and say "Look at where I started, look where I am now". My long term goal is to still have the opportunity to work and travel abroad to the USA where my partner is from, temporarily.
        Whether it's working for a NZ based company (I've managed through weird time zone differences before, I'm sure I can do it again) to help them broaden overseas or for an international company.

        One of my biggest strengths would be working with others, this has helped me immensely in foundations so far and I'm excited to continue it in bootcamp. 
        One of my limitations would be trying not to overwhelm myself with the unknown, google is a great tool and I cannot expect myself to retain every bit of information.
    </p>
    </div>

        Something I will focus on during bootcamp will be trying not to burn myself out quickly. Take breaks when needed, don't stay stuck on something for too long and to believe in myself.
        As foundations have progressed I have already seen some improvement in myself with this, however I will need to focus on it so my skills don't slip.
      </p>

        I would like to see my self-reflection/management skill developed most in the next few weeks, in the sense that I can manage myself when I need to take a break and come back or ask for help.
      </p>
      </div>

      <div class="blog-entries nicer-text">

        <p>
        My expectations from the bootcamp team are the same as foundations, just some understanding. As things don't click for me as easily as it does with others, sometimes I will need
        some extra paitence and understanding when I need to word something differently so it can stick in my brain better.  
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="blank">
        <p>
          My expectations of myself are making sure I only spend 20-30minutes on a problem before asking for help from another student or facillitator, I will also luckily have my own mentor as Released here in Hawke's Bay so also using their space as a study space and asking for help there as well. I don't want to be stuck on a problem for a pro-longed amount of time, but also making sure I give it my best attempt so I can explain to whomever I'm asking for help, what I thought was best so they can steer me in the right direction. I will be making sure I work 8:45-5:15/5:30 plus some time after dinner and weekend work if there is a lot of work that needs to be completed. However I will make sure I make my proper breaks per day plus some relax time on the weekends so I can properly rest.
