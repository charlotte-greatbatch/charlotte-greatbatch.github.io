        <p class="blog-entries"> My long-term goal or dream is to become a web developer capable of traveling the world, so I can work anywhere I go. My partner is from the USA and I would love to live over there with his family for a few years and still be able to work for an NZ company,
          or work for a company based in the US and still be able to travel around and experience all of the tourist things. </p>

          <p> One of my favourite things about life is I love listening, I love watching ted talks and I love learning new things every single day.
            When it comes to web development, even in the past couple of weeks learning the basics, I've felt myself become more curious. Especially when something didn't work the previous day,
          I feel even more motivated and determined to figure out what went wrong and how I can fix it and how I can make it work the next.
         </p>

  <p class="blog-entries">It's incredibly important to maintain self-care no matter how far into a project or assignment you are. Even 5minute breaks every 30mins or hour will make a big difference to your mental load.
    Personally, I'm treating DA like a job. Get up and get to "work" at 9am, finish sometime after 5pm, making sure to take a break every half hour to hour. Drinking plenty of water, trying to get a healthy amount of sleep.
    When in the position to work with others, I will be respectful of what they need whether its help, listening or engagement.
    Its enevitable that things will become stressful when things move further through foundations and bootcamp, I think it's important for when it feels like the stress is getting out of control to
    being honest with yourself and the people around you. I believe it would be best to formulate an idea of why it feels stressful, what's not working,
    take a breath and step away for 10-15mins. If it still feels stressful/things are not working out and I've already asked for help through the discord, it's best to try and schedule a one on one with my
    facillitator to walk through a plan of how to get over this roadblock. I think it's also important to share my feelings with some loved ones around me to have some moral support as well.
  </p>

  <p>The main things I would expect from the facillitator's themselves is support and understanding, which they already do anyway. 
    Personally, sometimes things don't click for me as easily as it does for other people so just having some understanding when I ask multiple questions just so the certain idea solidifies for me.</p>
    
  <p class="blog-entries">I do not have any other commitments that might interfere with my time at DA. </p>
