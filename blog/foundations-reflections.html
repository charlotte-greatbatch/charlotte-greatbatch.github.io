              What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>I need to be nicer to myself when it comes to difficult or challenging things, blaming myself will get me no where.</li>
                <li>Don't let me own ego get infront of the fact that I need help, it serves 0 purpose to feel embarrassed when I cannot do something on my own</li>
                <li>Failure is not due to taking breaks, failure is due to not taking enough breaks.</li>

              What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming? 
            </p>
            <p>
              Every day is different, and even if you've been programming every day for 10 years your bound to still be learning new things now.
              From what I understand, programming can focus on working in groups or squads so having values, empathy and self-awareness play key roles in how you interact with your squad members.
              Recognising your values gives you a great idea of what is important to you so you can clearly communicate them to your team if you are comfortable. Otherwise, it gives you a good idea if someone crosses those the line with those values and you will be more prepared to communicate with the specific team member about what happened and how to move forward from there.
              Same with empathy, if you end up crossing over someone else's values without realising, they can come to you with their concerns and it can be communicated from there so you don't cross those lines again, instead of being mad or upset that someone is mad or upset with you, it can turn into a learning experience and move forward positively.
              Self-awareness is key to keep good communication skills when it comes to learning and programming. Instead sitting stuck with a problem for too long and going insane, reaching out to another student/teacher/team member for help will save you a lot of time, and will make for a better outcome than staying stuck on a problem for hours.

              What has surprised you the most about the core learning?
            </p>
            <p>
              How I thought i knew myself better than anyone, facing the core learning competinces really made me step back and realise maybe I don't know myself as well as I thought.

              What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?
              </p>
            <p>
              Truly finding the right answers about myself, instead of doubting myself or over thinking it I had to trust my gut and follow the idea all the way through.

              Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?
            </p>
            <p>
              Because when applying for jobs after this course, because we don't have the practise of a 4 year degree to find a job will truly rely on our core skills. To make sure we understand ourselves so we can show future employers that even though we can't do certain things that a 4 year degree does, we have the right mindset and attitude to slide right into work and continue learning that way.

              Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.
            </p>
            <p>
              Not at all, if anything I would've probably stopped this course if I didn't have any time to focus on core. The core learning has taught me to be kind to myself, things can be frustrating but it's how you deal with that frustration to overcome a problem.
