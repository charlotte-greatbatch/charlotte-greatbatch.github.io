  <h2 class="headings">A time I was blocked on a simple problem</h2>
    <p>
        I was working on JS Intro Operators where it was asking to make a function to plus some numbers together, so I did that!
        It wanted 3 + 7 so I wrote out
    </p>
    <p>
      function addNum(num1, num2) {
    </p>
    <span>
          return 3 + 7 }
    </span>
    <p>
      But then it wanted 11 + 2? How am I supposed to get 3 + 7 and 11 + 2 give me the same answer? It's just not possible. I was stumped.
    </p>
    <p>
      Until... after some thought, I took a step back and read the question again. Then, I realised, they have the math equations already written out
      somewhere that I can't see, I'm not supposed to make it literal. They just want a placeholder for the questions to come into effect. e.g 
    </p>
    <p> 
      function addNum(num1, num2) {
        </p>
      <p>
        return num1 + num2 }
      </p>
      <p>
        Suddenly all of the questions turned green and I felt silly. Sometimes you truly need to take a step back and look at the bigger picture.
      </p>
      <p>
        Instead of getting hung up on some numbers....

    <p>
      Would you believe that once I took a step back from the Operators, and looked at it as a whole, it clicked?
    </p>
    <p>
      Next question they asked to subtract numbers. BOOM, I knew that! It became
    </p>
    <p>
     return num1 - num2
    </p>
    <p>
      Same for division!
    </p>
    <p>
      return num1 / num2 
    </p>
    And multiplication
    <p>
      <p>
        return num1 * num2
      </p>
      Basic maths, we got there team. Smooth as butter.

  <h2 class="headings">Reflect on how confident you feel using each of these problem-solving techniques/processes</h2>
<ul class="blog">
  <li>Pseudocode</li>
  <li>Trying something</li>
  <li>Rubber ducky method</li>
  <li>Reading error messages</li>
  <li>Console.logging</li>
  <li>Googling</li>
  <li>Asking your peers for help</li>
  <li>Asking coaches for help</li>
  <li>Improving your process with reflection</li>
</ul>
 
    <p>
       Personally I feel pretty confident on these processes! I love the rubber ducky method as it also just applies to a lot of life scenarios as well. 
       Also I believe it goes hand in hand with asking for help with peers and facilitators.
    </p>
    <p> 
      I certainly use both pseudocode and reflection at the same time, pseudocode is amazing the way things can be layed out as plainly as I need it to I can process
      and come to a conclusion on a problem.
    </p>
    <p>
      The better I become with coding and knowing the right terminology, the better at googling I will be as well.
