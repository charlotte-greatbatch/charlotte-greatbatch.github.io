      <div class="welcome"> <h3 class="headings">Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people</h3>
        <p>It gives people the building blocks to be better. Whether it's to get better after an injury or be better at a certain skill. It free's the mind of barriers or self-doubt if something becomes difficult</p>

        <h3 class="headings">Discuss how you might engage with principles of neuroplasticity for your benefit</h3>
        <p>Practise practise practise. Pulling repetition and use it for lose it together, not to be fulfilled when you understand something. Congratulate yourself for the achievement
          but also do it some more! Whether it's more research or jumping onto freeCodeCamp to put the knowledge to work.

        <h3 class="headings">What are some ways to increase your neuroplasticity?</h3>
        <p>Learning something new! It ignites the part of your brain to form new pathways, a chance to change your brain's default operation.
          It's also just exciting to learn something new! Something as simple or challenging, is using your non-dominent hand for simple tasks like brushing your teeth or cleaning.
          The task itself is something you're familiar with, however it takes extra effort to do with your non-dominent hand.

  <h3 class="headings">Discuss what it is and why it is relevant</h3>
  <p>A growth mindset is when you believe that intelligence and talent can be improved. It's relevant because it helps your ability to embrace flaws and mistakes and have the drive to
    improve. The endless hunger for learning and adapting in rapid environments.

<h3 class="headings"> Did anything surprise you? Change for you?</h3>
<p> It gave me a really good perspective on how it relates to coding and with practise I've had so far it is definitely better to have/practise a growth mindset.</p>
</div>

<div class="welcome">
<h3 class="headings">How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?</h3>
<p>Practise. Keep learning, keep researching, keep doing. Just because I've completed a task doesn't mean I'm done. Checking the discord to see if I can also help someone, asking questions and always staying curious.
  I've learnt so far on my journey, with coding there is no right answer, it's not always black or white. Sometimes there are multiple ways to answer a problem and I need to keep myself aware of that!

  <h3 class="headings">Reflect and discuss how these understandings may shape or influence your learning plan and strategy</h3>
<p>Reflecting on my learning plan I would like to try and build on a growth-mindset, I think I already have some of the basic building blocks for it as I love to learn and listen.
  I want to become more curious to learn the ideas and practises we're doing now and to keep myself learning and not become stagnent because I grasped the idea of something.
